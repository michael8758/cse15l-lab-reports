Keys pressed: `ssh mil118@ieng6.ucsd.edu` `<enter>`. Typing `ssh mil118@ieng6.ucsd.edu` is the command to log into my ieng6 account, and `<enter>` is the command used to execute this command.

Keys pressed: git clone `<Command-V>` `<enter>`. I had previously copied my `SSH` URL using `<Command-C>`, so I pasted it into the command line using `<Command-V>`. I then press `<enter>` to execute the command.

Keys pressed: cd l `<tab>` `<enter>`. I am using `cd` to change my directory to lab7, which contains all the code and test files. I then type `l` and `<tab>` because pressing `<tab>` autocompletes the command/path you are writing, and by writing `l`, it matches with the existing paths and completes it based on the existing paths.
