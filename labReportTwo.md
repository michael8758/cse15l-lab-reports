Which methods in your code are called?
What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?
How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.

## Part Three
**What I learned in week 2 and 3**

Throughout week 2 and week 3, a plethora of new concepts and ideas was introduced to me in which I had never had experience using before. For example, It was my first experience creating a web server and I was also introduced to the technical aspects of it such as the port that it runs on. I also learned that such methods are used for collaboration purposes, where multiple users can make edits or changes to the same documents or pages as long as they are on the same server. Furthermore, I also learned about commands such as `mkdir` and `scp`, which stand for 'make directory' and 'secure copy protocol' and their applications in making code writing more efficient.
