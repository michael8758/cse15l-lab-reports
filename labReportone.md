*working directory: home directory*

- cd stands for "change directory", which allows you to change the current working directory to the given path, executing the cd command with no argument will change the directory to the home directory, but since I am already in the home directory, executing the cd command with no argument will not change my directory.


**cd - path to directory as an argument**

**cd - path to a file as an argument**

*working directory: home directory*

ls stands for "list", which lists the files and folders in the given path. Since I am currently in the home directory, the ls command lists "hello.txt" and "lecture1" because those are the file and folder located in the home directory. This is not an error.

*working directory: home directory*

the command line shows "cd lecture1", in which I am changing the directory from the home directory to the lecture1 directory. After the command is executed, the prompt updates to the directory that I am in - "lecture1" - which is highlighted in green.
